# read

`(read HANDLE)`

The function `read` reads all the bytes in the file from the current
file and returns a bytes sequence.

Examples:

This example assumes you have a text file with a UTF-8 encoding at /tmp/test.txt. You
can create one from bash with:

```bash
$ echo -n 'a delicious soufflé and a spoon' > /tmp/test.txt
```

You can now try this Trifle code:

```lisp
> (set! h (open "/tmp/test.txt" :read))
null
> (read h)
#bytes("a delicous souffl\xc3\xa9 and a spoon")
```

You should close file handles when you are finished with them. When
your program terminates, your file handles are closed
automatically. However, you may run out of file handles if your
program runs for a long time.
